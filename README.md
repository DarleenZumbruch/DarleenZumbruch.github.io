## Technical Documentation

### Prerequisites
**Git installed**

Check if Git has already been installed by running the following command in your command line interface.
```
git --version
```
If you don’t receive a “Git version” message, it means that you need to download and install Git. 
The instructions how to install Git can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 


### Installing
**Clone Repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/DarleenZumbruch/DarleenZumbruch.github.io.git
```


## Tools
### command line interface

To manage and version my files and code, I used the command line. I commited with `git commit` when I have successfully implemented a new function or look and created branches `git checkout -b <name-of-branch>` to make bigger changes and have a backup when something breaks apart. One branch is called `gh-pages`, where to find the code that can be seen [here](https://github.com/DarleenZumbruch/DarleenZumbruch.github.io) on the website.


### Console

To view my results I chose the browser Chrome, because if something didn't work I used the console to debug.


### Webstorm

To create and edit the code I used WebStorm.


### p5.js

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding. It allowed me to create graphics and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing.


### github Pages
